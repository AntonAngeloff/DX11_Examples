The motivation of this tutorial is do demonstrate some basic workflow 
of Direct3D 11, and how to start a very basic framework, since there are 
not much resources on the subject for FreePascal/Delphi and it can be rather 
hard to get started.

The samples are currently tested with FPC 3.0.1 (with Lazarus 1.4RC1) on Windows.

For any ideas, problems or suggestions please write to antonn.angelov@gmail.com.

How to compile:
  - First you have to download the headers (see below)
  - Then you either have to use FPC 3.0.0 (or later version) or Delphi XE3 (or later) (Delphi version of examples is not ready yet!)

Header translations:
  - These examples are based on the translations provided by CMCHTPC @ https://github.com/CMCHTPC/DelphiDX12 . You have to download the headers from their original location before compiling the examples.
  - With some modification it should possible to make them compile with JSB or other translations.

TODO:
  - Write tutorials in a blog and put links here
  - Add another tutorial to demonstrate usage of a camera class and more generic model class
  - Add tutorial to demonstrate normal mapping
